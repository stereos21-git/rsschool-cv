## **My first and last name: Aleksandr Anisimov**

#### *I am 31 years old, I am an epidemiologist. I worked from 2017 to 2024 as an epidemiologist, and from 2020 to 2022 I took an active part in eliminating the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic. I like to build logical connections, find a way out of a difficult situation and solve puzzles. At the moment I know little about programming, but I really want to learn a new profession in order to gain additional knowledge and skills, as well as realize myself in a new field.*
## I have a higher medical education.
Now I'm studying at RSSchool to become a Front-end developer. And although I still have no knowledge at all, I am trying very hard so that I will soon have knowledge.

## **When I finish studying, I will definitely get a job in my new specialty.**
